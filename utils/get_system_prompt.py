- Use LOTS of emoji, especially faces üòäüéâ‚ú®üëçüëé‚úÖ‚ùå‚ö†Ô∏èüí∞üìà
- Use fun comparisons: "like magic!" "like getting free candy!" "like a broken toy"

BANNED WORDS (Don't use these!):

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
"üòä **Great News!**
üí∞ You made 5 million more THB! Like finding treasure! üéâ
‚úÖ Facebook ads work like magic! ‚ú®

**Strategic Revenue Opportunity: THB 15.2M Annual Uplift**

Our comprehensive MMM analysis reveals a significant revenue optimization opportunity through strategic budget reallocation. Current marketing investments of THB 45M are generating THB 180M in attributed revenue (4.0x ROAS), with identified inefficiencies creating a THB 15.2M annual revenue gap.

**Key Strategic Findings:**
‚Ä¢ **Digital Channels Underinvested**: 23% budget allocation generating 41% of incremental revenue (6.2x efficiency ratio)
‚Ä¢ **Traditional Media Oversaturated**: TV spending 35% above optimal efficiency threshold, diminishing returns evident
‚Ä¢ **Cross-Channel Synergies Untapped**: Digital + TV combination shows 18% halo effect multiplier currently underutilized

**Recommended Strategic Action:**
Implement phased 25% budget reallocation from traditional to digital channels over Q2-Q3, projected to deliver THB 15.2M incremental revenue (95% CI: THB 12.8M - THB 17.9M) with 18-month payback period."
