Title: Return on investment

Insights: Your return on investment (ROI) helps
you understand how your marketing activities impacted your business objectives.
Meta drove the highest ROI at 5.1. For every $1
you spent on Meta, you saw $5.11 in revenue.
Dv_360_X1 had the highest effectiveness, which is your
incremental outcome per media unit. Meta had the highest marginal
ROI at 2.08. Meta drove the lowest CPIK
at $0.20. For every KPI unit, you spent $0.20.
ROI vs Effectiveness Analysis:

Performance Overview:
- Average ROI across channels: 4.8x
- Average effectiveness: 0.0169 incremental outcome per impression
- Total media spend analyzed: $2,340,830

ROI Rankings:
1. META: 5.1x ROI
2. TIKTOK: 5.0x ROI
3. GOOGLE: 4.6x ROI
4. DV_360_X1: 4.6x ROI

Effectiveness Rankings:
1. DV_360_X1: 0.0491 outcome per impression
2. GOOGLE: 0.0065 outcome per impression
3. META: 0.0062 outcome per impression
4. TIKTOK: 0.0057 outcome per impression

Spend Allocation:
1. DV_360_X1: $1,558,208 (66.6% of total spend)
2. GOOGLE: $526,693 (22.5% of total spend)
3. META: $243,623 (10.4% of total spend)
4. TIKTOK: $12,306 (0.5% of total spend)

Channel Performance Categories:

High Potential:
- DV_360_X1 (4.6x ROI, 0.0491 effectiveness)

Optimization Needed:
- GOOGLE (4.6x ROI, 0.0065 effectiveness)

Cost Efficient:
- META (5.1x ROI, 0.0062 effectiveness)
- TIKTOK (5.0x ROI, 0.0057 effectiveness)

Strategic Insights:
- META delivers highest ROI (5.1x) - prioritize for budget allocation
- DV_360_X1 shows highest effectiveness (0.0491) - strong media performance per impression
- DV_360_X1 receives largest budget ($1,558,208) - monitor efficiency closely
- DV_360_X1: High effectiveness but expensive - optimize costs to improve ROI
- GOOGLE: Both ROI and effectiveness below average - requires optimization or budget reallocation
- META: Cost efficient but low reach - consider scaling if effectiveness can be maintained
- TIKTOK: Cost efficient but low reach - consider scaling if effectiveness can be maintained

Methodology: Note: Effectiveness measures the
incremental outcome generated per impression. A low ROI does not necessarily
imply low media effectiveness; it may result from high media cost, as positioned
in the upper-left corner of the chart. Conversely, a high ROI can coexist with
low media effectiveness and low media costs, as indicated in the bottom-right
corner of the chart. The diagonal section of the chart suggests that the ROI is
primarily influenced by media effectiveness. The size of the bubbles represents
the scale of the media spend.
ROI vs Marginal ROI Performance Analysis:

Performance Metrics:
- Average ROI across channels: 4.8x
- Average Marginal ROI: 2.0x (additional return per additional dollar)
- Total media spend analyzed: $2,340,830

ROI Rankings:
1. META: 5.1x ROI
2. TIKTOK: 5.0x ROI
3. GOOGLE: 4.6x ROI
4. DV_360_X1: 4.6x ROI

Marginal ROI Rankings (Incremental Efficiency):
1. META: 2.1x marginal ROI
2. TIKTOK: 2.0x marginal ROI
3. GOOGLE: 1.9x marginal ROI
4. DV_360_X1: 1.8x marginal ROI

Spend Distribution:
1. DV_360_X1: $1,558,208 (66.6% of total spend)
2. GOOGLE: $526,693 (22.5% of total spend)
3. META: $243,623 (10.4% of total spend)
4. TIKTOK: $12,306 (0.5% of total spend)

Saturation Indicators:
- DV_360_X1: High saturation signal (ROI/Marginal ROI ratio: 2.6x)
- GOOGLE: Moderate saturation signal (ROI/Marginal ROI ratio: 2.4x)
- META: Moderate saturation signal (ROI/Marginal ROI ratio: 2.5x)
- TIKTOK: Moderate saturation signal (ROI/Marginal ROI ratio: 2.5x)

Efficiency Gap Analysis:
- DV_360_X1: 2.9x gap between current and marginal returns
- GOOGLE: 2.7x gap between current and marginal returns
- META: 3.0x gap between current and marginal returns
- TIKTOK: 3.0x gap between current and marginal returns

Performance Consistency:
- ROI variation across channels: 0.21 standard deviation
- Marginal ROI variation: 0.12 standard deviation
- ROI and marginal ROI show similar variation patterns

Channel Performance Patterns:
- META leads in both ROI and marginal ROI - consistent high performer
- DV_360_X1: High spend concentration (66.6%) with below-average marginal efficiency
- META: Low spend allocation (10.4%) but above-average marginal efficiency
- TIKTOK: Low spend allocation (0.5%) but above-average marginal efficiency

Diminishing Returns Assessment:
- DV_360_X1: Moderate diminishing returns (current ROI 2.6x higher than marginal)
- GOOGLE: Moderate diminishing returns (current ROI 2.4x higher than marginal)
- META: Moderate diminishing returns (current ROI 2.5x higher than marginal)
- TIKTOK: Moderate diminishing returns (current ROI 2.5x higher than marginal)

Methodology: Note: Marginal ROI measures the additional
return generated for every additional dollar spent. It's an indicator of
efficiency of additional spend. Channels with a high ROI but a low marginal ROI
are likely in the saturation phase, where the initial investments have paid off,
but additional investment does not bring in as much return. Conversely, channels
that have a high ROI and a high marginal ROI perform well and continue to yield
high returns with additional spending. The size of the bubbles represents the
scale of the media spend.
