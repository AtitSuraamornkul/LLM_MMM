Channel Performance Categories:

Optimization Needed:
- KOL (3.9x ROI, 3.8645 effectiveness)
- TV_SPOT (1.3x ROI, 1.2550 effectiveness)
- ACTIVATION (3.8x ROI, 3.8338 effectiveness)
- FACEBOOK (3.6x ROI, 3.5885 effectiveness)

Star Performers:
- TV_SPONSOR (5.0x ROI, 4.9981 effectiveness)
- RADIO (4.5x ROI, 4.5270 effectiveness)
- TIKTOK (5.0x ROI, 5.0002 effectiveness)
- KOL_BOOST (5.0x ROI, 5.0005 effectiveness)

Strategic Insights:
- KOL_BOOST delivers highest ROI (5.0x) - prioritize for budget allocation
- KOL_BOOST shows highest effectiveness (5.0005) - strong media performance per impression
- ACTIVATION receives largest budget (THB12,963,048) - monitor efficiency closely
- KOL: Both ROI and effectiveness below average - requires optimization or budget reallocation
- TV_SPOT: Both ROI and effectiveness below average - requires optimization or budget reallocation
- TV_SPONSOR: Ideal performance - high ROI and effectiveness, maintain investment
- RADIO: Ideal performance - high ROI and effectiveness, maintain investment
- ACTIVATION: Both ROI and effectiveness below average - requires optimization or budget reallocation
- FACEBOOK: Both ROI and effectiveness below average - requires optimization or budget reallocation
- YOUTUBE: Both ROI and effectiveness below average - requires optimization or budget reallocation
- TIKTOK: Ideal performance - high ROI and effectiveness, maintain investment
- KOL_BOOST: Ideal performance - high ROI and effectiveness, maintain investment

Methodology: Note: Effectiveness measures the
incremental outcome generated per impression. A low ROI does not necessarily
imply low media effectiveness; it may result from high media cost, as positioned
in the upper-left corner of the chart. Conversely, a high ROI can coexist with
low media effectiveness and low media costs, as indicated in the bottom-right
corner of the chart. The diagonal section of the chart suggests that the ROI is
primarily influenced by media effectiveness. The size of the bubbles represents
the scale of the media spend.

- TIKTOK: High saturation signal (ROI/Marginal ROI ratio: 3.4x)
- KOL_BOOST: Low saturation signal (ROI/Marginal ROI ratio: 2.0x)

Efficiency Gap Analysis:
- KOL: 2.0x gap between current and marginal returns
- TV_SPOT: 0.7x gap between current and marginal returns
- TV_SPONSOR: 2.0x gap between current and marginal returns
- RADIO: 3.1x gap between current and marginal returns

- YOUTUBE: 1.5x gap between current and marginal returns
- TIKTOK: 3.5x gap between current and marginal returns
- KOL_BOOST: 2.5x gap between current and marginal returns

Performance Consistency:
- ROI variation across channels: 1.11 standard deviation
- Marginal ROI variation: 0.70 standard deviation
- ROI and marginal ROI show similar variation patterns

Channel Performance Patterns:
- KOL_BOOST has highest ROI while TV_SPONSOR has highest marginal ROI - different optimization opportunities
- KOL: Low spend allocation (11.4%) but above-average marginal efficiency
- TV_SPONSOR: Low spend allocation (0.8%) but above-average marginal efficiency
- YOUTUBE: Low spend allocation (9.7%) but above-average marginal efficiency
- KOL_BOOST: Low spend allocation (0.6%) but above-average marginal efficiency

Diminishing Returns Assessment:
- KOL: Moderate diminishing returns (current ROI 2.1x higher than marginal)
- TV_SPOT: Moderate diminishing returns (current ROI 2.1x higher than marginal)
- TV_SPONSOR: Minimal diminishing returns (current ROI 1.7x higher than marginal)
- RADIO: Strong diminishing returns pattern (current ROI 3.2x higher than marginal)
- ACTIVATION: Minimal diminishing returns (current ROI 1.8x higher than marginal)
- FACEBOOK: Moderate diminishing returns (current ROI 2.7x higher than marginal)
- YOUTUBE: Minimal diminishing returns (current ROI 1.6x higher than marginal)
- TIKTOK: Strong diminishing returns pattern (current ROI 3.4x higher than marginal)
- KOL_BOOST: Minimal diminishing returns (current ROI 2.0x higher than marginal)

Methodology: Note: Marginal ROI measures the additional
return generated for every additional dollar spent. It's an indicator of
efficiency of additional spend. Channels with a high ROI but a low marginal ROI
are likely in the saturation phase, where the initial investments have paid off,
but additional investment does not bring in as much return. Conversely, channels
that have a high ROI and a high marginal ROI perform well and continue to yield
high returns with additional spending. The size of the bubbles represents the
scale of the media spend.
