  {
  "prompt": "Q: Which marketing channel is the most efficient in terms of ROI and why?",
  "completion": "A: KOL_BOOST is the most efficient marketing channel in terms of ROI. It delivers the highest ROI at 5.0x, meaning for every THB 1 spent, it generates THB 5 in revenue. Additionally, it has the highest effectiveness and the lowest cost per incremental KPI (CPIK), making it the most cost-effective and impactful channel for budget allocation.\n\n(Source: Channel Efficiency Analysis and ROI Performance)"
  },
  {
  "prompt": "Q: Which channels are underperforming and should have their budgets reduced?",
  "completion": "A: TV_SPOT is underperforming and should have its budget reduced. It has the lowest ROI (1.3x) and the lowest revenue/spend efficiency (0.39), indicating poor return on investment compared to other channels. Other channels may require optimization, but TV_SPOT stands out as the least efficient and should be prioritized for budget cuts.\n\n(Source: Channel Efficiency Analysis and Channel Performance Comparison)"

  "completion": "A: YouTube outperforms Facebook in both ROI and revenue contribution:\n\n- ROI: YouTube has a higher ROI (3.98x) compared to Facebook (3.59x).\n- Revenue Contribution: YouTube contributes 1.4% of total revenue (THB 17,402,620), while Facebook contributes 2.1% (THB 25,648,736). However, as a share of marketing channel revenue, YouTube is more efficient relative to spend.\n\nOverall, YouTube is more efficient (higher ROI), but Facebook drives a higher absolute revenue contribution.\n\n(Source: Marketing Channel Performance and ROI data)"

  {
  "prompt": "Q: If you had to cut 10% from the overall budget, which channels would you reduce first and why?",
  "completion": "A: To cut 10% from the overall budget, you should reduce spend first from underperforming and less efficient channels:\n\n- Priority for reduction: TV_SPOT (lowest ROI at 1.3x and lowest revenue/spend efficiency at 0.39)\n- Consider further reductions from channels with moderate ROI and signs of diminishing returns, such as Facebook and Radio, but prioritize TV_SPOT for initial cuts.\n\nThis approach minimizes negative impact on overall incremental revenue and ROI.\n\n(Source: Channel Efficiency Analysis, ROI Performance, and Spend Scale Differences)"

  {
  "prompt": "Q: For the Activation channel, was a point of diminishing returns identified? What does this mean for future budget allocation?",
  "completion": "A: No clear point of diminishing returns was identified for the Activation channel. This means there is still opportunity to increase investment in Activation, as additional spend is expected to yield further incremental revenue without significant loss in efficiency. However, ongoing monitoring is recommended to detect when diminishing returns may begin to appear.\n\n(Source: Channel: Activation analysis)"
  },
  {
  "prompt": "Q: Are there any channels where the difference in ROI is not statistically significant?",
  "completion": "A: Yes, for most channels, the difference in ROI is not statistically significant due to overlapping confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences are only observed when comparing channels like Facebook, KOL, KOL_BOOST, Radio, TikTok, TV_SPONSOR, and YouTube against TV_SPOT, where intervals do not overlap. For all other channel pairs, the differences are not statistically significant.\n\n(Source: ROI Statistical Significance analysis)"
  },
  {
  "prompt": "Q: How is ROI calculated in this analysis?",
  "completion": "A: ROI (Return on Investment) is calculated by dividing the revenue attributed to a marketing channel by the marketing costs for that channel:\n\nROI = (Revenue from channel) / (Marketing spend on channel)\n\n(Source: Methodology note in ROI and CPIK Performance Analysis)"
  },
  {
  "prompt": "Q: What does marginal ROI mean, and why is it important for budget decisions?",
  "completion": "A: Marginal ROI measures the additional return generated for every additional THB spent on a channel. It is important for budget decisions because it indicates the efficiency of incremental spend. Channels with high marginal ROI can absorb more budget effectively, while those with low marginal ROI may be nearing saturation, making further investment less efficient.\n\n(Source: Methodology and ROI vs Marginal ROI Performance Analysis)"
  },
  {
  "prompt": "Q: What would happen to total incremental revenue if the Activation budget was increased by 25%?",
  "completion": "A: If the Activation budget was increased by 25%, the expected incremental revenue from Activation would increase by approximately THB 6,376,468, with a marginal ROI of 1.97x. This means that for each additional THB spent, nearly THB 2 in incremental revenue is expected.\n\n(Source: 25% Spend Increase Scenario Analysis for Activation)"

  "prompt": "Q: How did TV_Spot’s performance change after optimization?",
  "completion": "A: After optimization, TV_SPOT's incremental revenue decreased by THB 2,371,982. The budget for TV_SPOT was reduced, reflecting its low ROI (1.3x) and underperformance compared to other channels. This reallocation improved overall marketing efficiency.\n\n(Source: Channel revenue change after optimization and ROI Performance)"

  "completion": "A: Reallocating budget from underperforming channels (like TV_SPOT) to high-performing channels (such as KOL_BOOST, TV_SPONSOR, and Radio) is expected to increase overall ROI and incremental revenue.

  "completion": "A: The high baseline (organic) revenue share (88%) means that the majority of business revenue is generated without direct marketing spend. This indicates strong underlying brand equity or market demand, and suggests that marketing investments should be carefully targeted to maximize incremental returns rather than simply driving volume.\n\n(Source: Revenue Attribution and Key Insights)"
