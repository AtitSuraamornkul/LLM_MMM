Insights:
1. These are the estimated results
from a fixed budget scenario with a channel-level spend constraint of
-30% to +30% of the non-optimized spend. The non-optimized spend for each
channel is equal to the historical spend during the period from 2022-07-04 to
2024-06-24.
2. You can see the channel-level budget shifts and
the performance lift after optimization.
3. These response curves depict the
relationship between marketing spend and the resulting incremental revenue and
show the optimal spend amount for each channel that maximizes the total
incremental revenue while staying within the channel-level spend
constraints.

Chart Title: Change in optimized spend for each channel
Description: Note: Each bar represents the change in
optimized spend for a channel. Negative values indicate a decrease in spend
while positive values indicate an increase from your non-optimized spend.

Chart Title: Optimized budget allocation
Description: Note: The "non_optimized" bar presents the
incremental revenue before optimization, and the subsequent bars represent the
change in incremental revenue for each channel based on the optimal spend
level. The final bar labeled "optimized" shows the total incremental revenue
after optimization.

Chart Title: Optimized incremental revenue across all channels
Description: Note: The "non_optimized" bar presents the
incremental revenue before optimization, and the subsequent bars represent the
change in incremental revenue for each channel based on the optimal spend
level. The final bar labeled "optimized" shows the total incremental revenue
after optimization.
