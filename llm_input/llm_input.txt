Time period: Dec 26, 2022 - Jun 2, 2025
Optimization Scenario Summary:
- Non-optimized budget: $2.3M
- Optimized budget: $2.3M (delta: $0)
- Non-optimized ROI: 4.7
- Optimized ROI: 4.7 (delta: 0.0)
- Non-optimized incremental revenue: $11M
- Optimized incremental revenue: $11M (delta: +$7k)

Budget Allocation Table:
- dv_360_x1: 67% → 64%
- google: 23% → 24%
- meta: 10% → 12%
- tiktok: 1% → 1%

Insights:
1. These are the estimated results
from a fixed budget scenario with a channel-level spend constraint of
-30% to +30% of the non-optimized spend. The non-optimized spend for each
channel is equal to the historical spend during the period from 2022-12-26 to
2025-05-26.
2. You can see the channel-level budget shifts and
the performance lift after optimization.
3. These response curves depict the
relationship between marketing spend and the resulting incremental revenue and
show the optimal spend amount for each channel that maximizes the total
incremental revenue while staying within the channel-level spend
constraints.

Chart Title: Change in optimized spend for each channel
Description: Note: Each bar represents the change in
optimized spend for a channel. Negative values indicate a decrease in spend
while positive values indicate an increase from your non-optimized spend.
Data Points:
dv_360_x1    | Spend Change: (Decrease) $-58,000
meta         | Spend Change: (Increase) $31,000
google       | Spend Change: (Increase) $25,000
tiktok       | Spend Change: (Increase) $2,000

Chart Title: Optimized budget allocation
Description: Note: The "non_optimized" bar presents the
incremental revenue before optimization, and the subsequent bars represent the
change in incremental revenue for each channel based on the optimal spend
level. The final bar labeled "optimized" shows the total incremental revenue
after optimization.
Data Points:
dv_360_x1    $1,500,000
google       $552,000
meta         $275,000
tiktok       $14,000

Percentage Allocation:
dv_360_x1    64.1%
google       23.6%
meta         11.7%
tiktok       0.6%

Chart Title: Optimized incremental revenue across all channels
Description: Note: The "non_optimized" bar presents the
incremental revenue before optimization, and the subsequent bars represent the
change in incremental revenue for each channel based on the optimal spend
level. The final bar labeled "optimized" shows the total incremental revenue
after optimization.
